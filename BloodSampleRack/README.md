# BloodSampleRack


## Notes
This project is done for a friend how is a veterianarien and asked for a 
blood sample rack for the samples he collects for his PhD (I am writing this to make the project less weired)

Either the outside of the rack or the blockplate have additional space for some decorations.
The following is the version I printed, whereas the lama on the blockplate was taken from thingiverse. 

## Assembly
The rack consists of four components
- rack
- plate (2x)
- blockplate

After printing the parts some adjustments using a file to get rid of uncertainties of the printer.
Finally, the rack can be assembled by inserting the plates into the rack and blocking their movement
with the blockpate.
The assebled version can also be seen in the following
